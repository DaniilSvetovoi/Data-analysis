# Real estate sale ads research

We have the data of the Yandex.RealEstate service â€” archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. It is necessary to determine the market value of real estate. Our task is to set the parameters. This will allow us to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

There are two types of data available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.
